# Basic Info
Well, what is the Insect Bot. Actually it's not really an insect because it only has four legs, insects does have six of them, right? However, the robot got the name because of his shape with the thin wire legs and the IR sensor rosed up.


That robot already has a long history. first I built one with standard servos and an Arduino UNO but soon I wanted it smaller and even more easy to build. After a couple of attempts with different designs this one is the final one.

## Programming the Insect Bot

To program the robot you need to have a computer with the Arduino IDE installed. 
The connected Beetle will show up as a Leonardo. Please choose this and select the proper COM port.
Open the previous downloaded file insect_bot_smooth_en.ino from below that instrucable and upload it to the Beetle.
Once it's done without errors the Insect Bot mini is ready to take his first steps.

## You need these parts
Here are the Component required for building this project. The list is quite a simple one :
